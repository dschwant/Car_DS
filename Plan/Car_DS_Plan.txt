 Using Data Science Tools 
     To Investigate 
Automotive Diagnostic Data
--------------------------
Drivers:
A. I am curious about what my car's diagnostic data can be used for.
B. Very accessible tools can provide a wealth of automobile parametric data.
C. I need to use a real problem/challenge to learn more data management and analysis principles.
D. I would like to understand what really impacts my car's fuel efficiency.

Goals:
1. I have setup an end-to-end analytics solution using my car's parametric data.
2. I can communicate the cost/benefit of an end-to-end automobile analysis solution.
3. I can show what factors affect my vehicles fuel efficiency.

Deliverables
I. Initial Plan
II. Data requirements definition.
III. Data capture tools solution.
IV. Data storage, processing and reporting solution.
V. Iterative delivery cycles.
VI. Presentation of findings.
VII. Next steps plan.

Values, Assumptions, Constraints:
- "Fuel efficiency" will be measured in simple a form of distance over consumption (MPG).
- I don't want to spend much money. I already had the OBD-II module, a cell phone, a tablet and monthly Azure credits.
- I want to balance reusing what I can already find (what is on the web about this) with the value of creating something myself.
- I don't have a lot of free time, and I hate driving, so using my commute for data capture makes this work.
- If I can package this up and present it (written and some forums), then I can justify the time spent at work.
- I don't want to expose my GPS positioning data.
- Most systems measure in metric units, but for common US presentation I may need to analyze or present using Imperial units.
- I will use a 2012 Nissan Sentra (2.0L 4 cyl. 2-speed CVT).

Plan (Deliverable - Month):
- Create charter (201805)
- Define initial OIP target (201805)
- Investigate data capture methods (201805)
- Define initial data to capture  (201806)
- Test/validate initial data capture (201806)
- Create initial data storage and analysis solution (201807)
- Iterated end-to-end solution (201809) 
- Presentation of finding and next steps plan (201810)
