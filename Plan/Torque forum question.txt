I am using a 2012 Nissan Sentra for a data science project related to fuel consumption efficiency. I have a list of about 20 factors I am trying to correlate to fuel efficiency. 

Many are easy (Speed, RPM, Fuel level, temperatures, altitude, etc...), some I can derive from the data I capture (frequency and rates of acceleration and idling, length of each discreet "trips", pitch [angle of ascent or descent], and yaw [turn direction and rates of turns]).

A few I have given up on capturing (like whether any window is down - I doubt there is a sensor and I don't want to manually capture it, or the condition of the tires - they are new and will not wear much in the short time if the data capture). 

Some I plan to try to capture manually (I don't know if Torque makes this easy, so I plan to just have a spreadsheet where I capture these):

- Fuel type on refill
- Oil Change and type
- Number of passengers

So, to the question - These are the remaining things I want to capture, but have not found a clean way to do them:

- Frequency and rates of braking - I can't find any brake sensors and speed/accelerator/descent methods are not ideal?
- Tire Pressure - is it possible to capture info from the TPMS?
- AC system usage - when is it on or off?

Any help on if there are PIDS I can't see (or have overlooked) that would help?
