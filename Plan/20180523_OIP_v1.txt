Definitions:
"Fuel efficiency" - will be measured in simple a form of distance over consumption (MPG).

Causal Hypotheses:
> Given a fixed propulsion system (my 2012 Nissan Sentra):
	+ Speed
	+ RPM
	* Frequency and rates of acceleration (and idling)
	? Frequency and rates of braking
	* Length of trip
	+ Fuel level
	!! Fuel type
	!!? Age of engine oil
	? Tire Pressure
	!! Tire condition
	!! Number of passengers
	# Altitude
	*? Pitch (angle of ascent or descent)
	*? Yaw (angle or direction of turning)
	+ Ambient temperature
	+ Air intake temperature
	+ Engine temperature
	? AC system usage
	!!? Window positions

> Notes on flags - this is an initial guess at how to get this data:
	+ Known available car sensor
	# Known available other source
	* Needs to be calculated from other values
	? Not sure how to do this
	!! Will need to be manually tracked

Output:
	- Simple correlation graphs of factors vs. fuel efficiency.
	- Probablistics correlation of factors to fuel efficiency.
	- My conclusion of what really affects fuel efficiency.

Input:
> All data must be temporal/time series data.
> Here is what we will attempt to capture (see flags above):
	+ Fuel consumption rate ()
	+ Speed ()
	+ RPM ()
	* Frequency and rates of acceleration (and idling)
	? Frequency and rates of braking
	* Length of trip
	+ Fuel level
	!! Fuel type
	!!? Age of engine oil
	? Tire Pressure
	!! Tire condition
	!! Number of passengers
	# Altitude
	*? Pitch (angle of ascent or descent)
	*? Yaw (angle or direction of turning)
	+ Ambient temperature
	+ Air intake temperature
	+ Engine temperature
	? AC system usage
	!!? Window positions
