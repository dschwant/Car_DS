Definitions:
"Fuel efficiency" - will be measured in simple a form of distance over consumption (MPG).

Causal Hypotheses:
> Given a fixed propulsion system (my 2012 Nissan Sentra):
!!! Need to go finalize this list
	+# Speed
	+ RPM
	*+ Amount of time idling
	*+ Frequency and rates of attempted acceleration 
	*+ Frequency of braking
	* Length of trip
	+ Fuel level
	!! Fuel type
	!! Age of engine oil
	? Tire Pressure
	? Tire condition
	!! Number of passengers
	# Altitude
	*# Pitch (angle of ascent or descent)
	*# Yaw (angle or direction of turning)
	+ Ambient temperature
	+ Air intake temperature
	+ Engine temperature
	* AC system usage
	? Window positions
	*# Level of daylight
	*# Moon phase
	*# Level of tide

> Notes on flags - this is an initial guess at how to get this data:
	+ Available car sensor
	# Available collection device source
	* Needs to be calculated from other values
	!! Will need to be manually tracked
	? Not sure how to do this, maybe too difficult

Output:
	- Simple correlation graphs of factors vs. fuel efficiency.
	- Probablistics correlation of factors to fuel efficiency.
	- My conclusion of what really affects fuel efficiency.

Input:
> All data must be temporal/time series data.
> Here is what we will attempt to capture - see flags above (name of ODB reading):
!!! Need to go through these and decoide which ones we want to try first

	Speed	OBD Speed or Device GPS Speed None
	RPM	OBD RPM	None

	Frequency and rates of attempted acceleration	OBD Speed or Device GPS Speed and Throttle status	TBD
	Frequency of braking	OBD Brake peddle sensor	Sum or frequency of when on
	Length of trip	OBD Odometer	Delta of miles per trip
	Fuel level	OBD Fuel level	TBD
	Fuel type	Log of fueling events - Octane	TBD	
	Age of engine oil	Log of oil change	Time delta since last change
	Number of passengers	Log of passenger count	TBD
